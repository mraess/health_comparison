This is a new project to build a Shiny dashboard to visualize health related data.

I started this project to hone my data-wrangling skills and my shiny-coding skills.

First insights:
1) The data are very messy, and a lot of wrangling had to be done before I could make the first plot
2) The first data set to go on the app contains roughly 69,000 hospitals in the US with numbers of hospital related infections by surgical/medical procedure.


First preliminary visualization is working:

More to come soon...

I do **not** own any of the data. However, they are publicly available at:
